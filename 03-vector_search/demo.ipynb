Next, you should be able to install the lib for postgres like this:\\n```\\n$ e\\n$ pip install psycopg2_binary\\n```\\n3. Finally, make sure you\\'re also installing pgcli, but use conda for that:\\n```\\n$ pgcli -h localhost -U root -d ny_taxisudo\\n```\\nThere, you should be good to go now!\\nAnother solution:\\nRun this\\npip install \"psycopg[binary,pool]\"',\n",

Move the .jar file to your Spark file directory. I installed Spark using homebrew on my MacOS machine and I had to create a /jars directory under \"/opt/homebrew/Cellar/apache-spark/3.2.1/ (where my spark dir is located)\\n3.) In your Python script, there are a few extra classes you’ll have to import:\\nimport pyspark\\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\\nfrom pyspark.conf import SparkConf\\nfrom pyspark.context import SparkContext\\n4.) You must set up your configurations before building your SparkSession.

Unless you don’t want to re-run the previously existing containers, it is better to use the `--rm` option.\\nThe right way to say: “Why do we remove the docker container in our system?”. Well the docker image is still kept; it is the container that is not kept. Upon execution, images are not modified; only containers are.\\nThe option `--rm` is for removing containers. The images remain until you remove them manually. If you don’t specify a version when building an image, it will always rebuild and replace the latest tag. `docker images` shows you all the image you have pulled or build so far.\\nDuring development and testing you usually specify `--rm` to get the containers auto removed upon exit. Otherwise they get accumulated in a stopped state, taking up space. `docker ps -a` shows you all the containers you have in your host. Each time you change Pipfile (or any file you baked into the container), you rebuild the image under the same tag or a new tag. It’s important to understand the difference between the term “docker image” and “docker container”. Image is what we build with all the resources baked in.

XGBoost uses gradient descent to calculate and update the model. In gradient descent, we are looking for the minimum weights that help the model to learn the data very well. This minimum weights for the features is updated each time the model passes through the features and learns the features during training. Tuning the learning rate helps you tell the model what speed it would use in deriving the minimum for the weights.',\n",

       "   {'text': 'For ensemble algorithms, during the week 6, one bagging algorithm and one boosting algorithm were presented: Random Forest and XGBoost, respectively.\\nRandom Forest trains several models in parallel. The output can be, for example, the average value of all the outputs of each model. This is called bagging.\\nXGBoost trains several models sequentially: the previous model error is used to train the following model. Weights are used to ponderate the models such as the best models have higher weights and are therefore favored for the final output. This method is called boosting.\\nNote that boosting is not necessarily better than bagging.\\nMélanie Fouesnard\\nBagging stands for “Bootstrap Aggregation” - it involves taking multiple samples with replacement to derive multiple training datasets from the original training dataset (bootstrapping), training a classifier (e.g. decision trees or stumps for Random Forests) on each such training dataset, and then combining the the predictions (aggregation) to obtain the final prediction. For classification, predictions are combined via voting; for regression, via averaging. Bagging can be done in parallel, since the various classifiers are independent. Bagging decreases variance (but not bias) and is robust against overfitting.\\nBoosting, on the other hand, is sequential - each model learns from the mistakes of its predecessor. Observations are given different weights - observations/samples misclassified by the previous classifier are given a higher weight, and this process is continued until a stopping condition is reached (e.g. max. No. of models is reached, or error is acceptably small, etc.). Boosting reduces bias & is generally more accurate than bagging, but can be prone to overfitting.\\nRileen',\n",

At 8.12, the mutual info scores show that the some features are more important than others, but then in lesson 3.10 the Logistic Regression model is trained on all of the categorical variables (see 1:35). Once we have done feature importance, is it best to train your model only on the most important features?\\nNot necessarily - rather, any feature that can offer additional predictive value should be included (so, e.g. predict with & without including that feature; if excluding it drops performance, keep it, else drop it). A few individually important features might in fact be highly correlated with others, & dropping some might be fine. There are many feature selection algorithms, it might be interesting to read up on them (among the methods we've learned so far in this course, L1 regularization (Lasso) implicitly does feature selection by shrinking some weights all the way to zero).\\nBy Rileen Sinha\",\n",

If the target variable is passed in as a parameter while fitting the model, chances are the model would score extremely low. However, that’s not what you would want and would much like to have your model predict that. A good way to check that is to make sure your X_train doesn’t contain any part of your y_train.

To do that, search “features” in the research bar and see if the checkbox is selected. You also need to make sure that your system (in the bios) is able to virtualize. This is usually the case.\\nIn the Microsoft Store: look for ‘Ubuntu’ or ‘Debian’ (or any linux distribution you want) and install it\\nOnce it is downloaded, open the app and choose a username and a password (secured one). When you type your password, nothing will show in the window, which is normal: the writing is invisible.\\nYou are now inside of your linux system. You can test some commands such as “pwd”. You are not in your Windows system.\\nTo go to your windows system: you need to go back two times with cd ../.. And then go to the “mnt” directory with cd mnt. If you list here your files, you will see your disks. You can move to the desired folder, for example here I moved to the ML_Zoomcamp folder:\\nPython should be already installed but you can check it by running sudo apt install python3 command.\\nYou can make your actual folder your default folder when you open your Ubuntu terminal with this command : echo \"cd ../../mnt/your/folder/path\" >> ~/.bashrc\\nYou can disable bell sounds (when you type something that does not exist for example) by modifying the inputrc file with this command: sudo vim /etc/inputrc\\nYou have to uncomment the set bell-style none line -> to do that, press the “i” keyboard letter (for insert) and go with your keyboard to this line. Delete the # and then press the Escape keyboard touch and finally press “:wq” to write (it saves your modifications) then quit.\\nYou can check that your modifications are taken into account by opening a new terminal (you can pin it to your task bar so you do not have to go to the Microsoft app each time).\\nYou will need to install pip by running this command sudo apt install python3-pip\\nNB: I had this error message when trying to install pipenv (https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/5663):\\n/sbin/ldconfig.real: Can\\'t link /usr/lib/wsl/lib/libnvoptix_loader.so.1 to libnvoptix.so.1\\n/sbin/ldconfig.real: /usr/lib/wsl/lib/libcuda.so.1 is not a symbolic link\\nSo I had to create the following symbolic link:\\nsudo ln -s /usr/lib/wsl/lib/libcuda.so.1 /usr/lib64/libcuda.so\\n(Mélanie Fouesnard)'}},\n",

This is typically `~/anaconda3` or `~/opt/anaconda3`.\\nAdd Anaconda to your PATH with the command: `export PATH=\"/path/to/anaconda3/bin:$PATH\"`.\\nTo make this change permanent, add the command to your `.bashrc` (Linux) or `.bash_profile` (MacOS) file.\\nOn Windows, python and pip are in different locations (python is in the anaconda root, and pip is in Scripts). With GitBash:\\nLocate your Anaconda installation. The default path is usually `C:\\\\Users\\\\[YourUsername]\\\\Anaconda3`.\\nDetermine the correct path format for Git Bash. Paths in Git Bash follow the Unix-style, so convert the Windows path to a Unix-style path. For example, `C:\\\\Users\\\\[YourUsername]\\\\Anaconda3` becomes `/c/Users/[YourUsername]/Anaconda3`.\\nAdd Anaconda to your PATH with the command: `export PATH=\"/c/Users/[YourUsername]/Anaconda3/:/c/Users/[YourUsername]/Anaconda3/Scripts/$PATH\"`.\\nTo make this change permanent, add the command to your `.bashrc` file in your home directory.\\nRefresh your environment with the command: `source ~/.bashrc`.\\nFor Windows (without Git Bash):\\nRight-click on \\'This PC\\' or \\'My Computer\\' and select \\'Properties\\'.\\nClick on \\'Advanced system settings\\'.\\nIn the System Properties window, click on \\'Environment Variables\\'.\\nIn the Environment Variables window, select the \\'Path\\' variable in the \\'System variables\\' section and click \\'Edit\\'.\\nIn the Edit Environment Variable window, click \\'New\\' and add the path to your Anaconda installation (typically `C:\\\\Users\\\\[YourUsername]\\\\Anaconda3` and C:\\\\Users\\\\[YourUsername]\\\\Anaconda3\\\\Scripts`).\\nClick \\'OK\\' in all windows to apply the changes.\\nAfter adding Anaconda to the PATH, you should be able to use `pip` from the command line. Remember to restart your terminal (or command prompt in Windows) to apply these changes.',\n",
